          Nepal is a multiethnic and multilingual country. The manifestation of autonomy to the major castes in their respective dominion can bring all people into the mainstream of development. So, these parties have brought forth the provision of the federal system of government. The second amendment in the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2007 has also accepted this notion. The federal system involves dual government system: state government and central government.
